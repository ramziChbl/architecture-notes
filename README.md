# Infrastructure Comparison Project

This repository contains detailed, code-based comparisons of different infrastructure-as-code (IaC) approaches for common cloud architectures. Each comparison is designed to be a practical, hands-on reference for making informed infrastructure decisions.

## How to Use

Each comparison is self-contained in its own directory under `comparisons/`. See the `README.md` in each directory for details on the specific comparison, including:

*   **Summary Table:** A quick overview of the key differences.
*   **Pros and Cons:** A detailed breakdown of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
*   **Decision Tree:** A guide to help you choose the best option for your specific needs.
*   **Terraform Code:** The actual IaC code used for the comparison.
*   **Cost Analysis:** A breakdown of the estimated costs for each approach.
*   **Benchmarks:** (Optional) Performance test results.

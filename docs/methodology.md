# Comparison Methodology

This document outlines the methodology used for the infrastructure comparisons in this project.

## Guiding Principles

*   **Reproducibility:** All comparisons are based on Terraform code that can be easily reproduced.
*   **Fairness:** We strive to create a level playing field for each technology being compared.
*   **Practicality:** The comparisons should based on real-world use cases and scenarios.

## Process

1.  **Define the Scope:** Each comparison starts with a clear definition of the services and features being compared.
2.  **Develop the Code:** Terraform code is written to provision the infrastructure for each technology.
3.  **Measure and Analyze:** We use a combination of tools and manual analysis to measure key metrics, such as cost, performance, and ease of use.
4.  **Document the Results:** The results are documented in a clear and concise manner, using tables, charts, and written analysis.

## Tools

*   **Terraform:** Used for infrastructure as code.
*   **Infracost:** Used for cost analysis.
*   **Custom Scripts:** Used for performance benchmarking and other tasks.
